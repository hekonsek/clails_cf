# Clails - cloud made easy

Clails is an opinionated toolkit which takes simple project definition in YML file and generates complete cloud
 templates ([AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) or 
 [GCP Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/)) from it. 
 Think "*[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) but for cloud*".
